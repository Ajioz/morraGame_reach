# Morra Game ðŸš€

This project is about building a smart contract with Reach framework that implements morra game logic a user friendly piece of art.

## Design with love by

[Ajiroghene Sunday](https://github.com/Ajioz)  

## Setup

- You must have WSL installed in your computer and Docker working too, to be able to run the containerized Reach application successfully.  
Follow the very comprehensive guide on how to get this done in the Quickstart section of the [Reach Docs](https://docs.reach.sh/quickstart/#quickstart).
- You should have a TestNet connected to your MetaMask Wallet, or instead use MyAlgo Wallet it spins a wallet in TestNet for you.  

## Usage

To run the app, on your terminal, after you have downloaded Reach through the setup, run the following commands to lauch the application and contract:

```shell
$ <path to your Reach file>/reach react
```

To set your TestNet before the run, use the following command:

```shell
$ REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=<The TestNet name> <path to your Reach file>/reach react
```

The supported options are ETH, ALGO, CFX, for the Ethereum, Algorand, and Conflux TestNets respectively.

## Gameplay

To enjoy this game, its best to open the app in two browser tabs, one for Alice (the Deployer) and one for Bob (the Attacher).
